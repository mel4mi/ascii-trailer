## Executable
You can download Version1.rar file and run it as a console application in windows environment. <br>
note: exe file is dependent on dr_dre.mp3 file



# Create your own banner
 1. you can change the image you want to print via the ascii_art variable
 2. pygame.mixer.music.load('dr_dre.mp3') to replace the music file you want
 3. you can choose your own application icon (for exe) || the favicon.ico you choose must be in the same folder as the python script
 4. finally make it into an exe
 ```
pyinstaller -i favicon.ico --onefile .\asama2.py
 ```
